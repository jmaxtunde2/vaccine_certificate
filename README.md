# vaccine_certificate

Vaccine_certificate project is a Blockchain-based COVID vaccination registration and monitoring. COVID-19 has changed almost all aspects of our lives. Governments around the world have imposed lockdowns to slow down the transmissions.
In this project, we have developed a contract that seamlessly integrates testing and vaccination systems, allowing the system to be transparent. The instant verification of any tamper-proof COVID-19 test result has been developed, which will serve as
“Test Certificates”. A transparent and efficient vaccination system has also been exhibited and implemented as the “Digital Vaccine Passport” (DVP) system.
